#Intrik8 CRM

Developed using NodeJS and mongodb.  Created as being a fully customizable hosted system.  Using plug-ins (Slabs), you are able to customize and enable and disable features when they are needed or not needed.  This will save resources and time.
#TODO


1.Figure out having a download system that downloads slabs when enabled.
